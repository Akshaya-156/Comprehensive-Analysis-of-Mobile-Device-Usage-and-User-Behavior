# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behavior

### Problem Statement:  <br>
This project analyzes mobile device usage and user behavior to understand: <br>

1.How users interact with mobile devices throughout the day.  <br>
2.The relationship between app categories and user engagement.  <br>
3.Insights into how factors like age, app type, and screen time impact overall behavior.  <br>

### Objective:  <br>
Provide actionable recommendations for improving user experience, optimizing app performance, and encouraging healthy mobile usage habits. 
The goal of this analysis is to:

1.Understand the distribution of key metrics such as app usage time, screen on time, battery drain, data usage, number of apps installed, and age across the users.<br>
2.Explore correlations between different numerical features to identify any relationships between user behavior metrics.<br>
3.Summmarize statistics to identify patterns, outliers, and central tendencies in the data.<br>

#### Dataset Overview: <br>
The dataset contains data about user behavior and smartphone usage patterns. Here is a breakdown of the dataset's columns and their descriptions: <br>

1.User ID: A unique identifier for each user (integer). <br>
2.Device Model: The smartphone model used by the user (string). <br>
3.Operating System: The operating system of the smartphone (either Android or iOS). <br>
4.App Usage Time (min/day): The average number of minutes per day the user spends on apps (integer). <br>
5.Screen On Time (hours/day): The average number of hours per day the user's screen is on (float). <br>
6.Battery Drain (mAh/day): The average battery consumption per day in milliampere-hours (mAh) (integer).<br>
7.Number of Apps Installed: The total number of apps installed on the user's device (integer).
8.Data Usage (MB/day): The average data consumption per day in megabytes (MB) (integer). <br>
9.Age: The age of the user (integer). <br>
10.Gender: The gender of the user (string, typically "Male" or "Female"). <br>
11.User Behavior Class: A categorical class representing user behavior (integer values from 1 to 5). <br>
